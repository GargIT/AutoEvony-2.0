They are effective against nearly all types of infantry." wikiDesc="The bow and arrow, invented in prehistoric times, greatly improved the hunting skills of early man, allowing him to kill his targets from a distance. The bow was eventually adapted for use in battle, and was first used by Egyptian, Persian, and Assyrian armies as early as 5000 BC. The range provided by the bow allowed small forces of archers to rout armies of superior number armed only with hand-to-hand weapons. Archers were often used to soften enemy resistance prior to sending in mounted and skirmishing forces. " typeId="7"/>

They are effective against other siege weapons. " wikiDesc="During the days of the conquest of Empire, the ballista proved its value many times, in sieges and battles, on ships and on the land. It was even used to quell riots. It is from the time of the Roman Empire that many of the archaeological finds of ballistae date and in these times that many of the authors, whose technical manuals and journal accounts used by archaeologists to reconstruct these weapons, wrote their accounts." typeId="11"/>

" wikiDesc="In its simplest form, a battering ram is just a large, heavy log carried by several people and propelled with force against an obstacle; the momentum of the ram would be sufficient to damage the target if the log were massive enough and/or it were moved quickly enough. In castles, defenders attempted to foil battering rams by dropping obstacles in front of the ram, such as a large sack of sawdust, just before it hit a wall, by using grappling hooks to immobilize the log, by setting the ram on fire, or by sallying to attack the ram directly." typeId="12"/>

Humans may ride some of the larger of these animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, singly or in teams, to pull (or haul) sleds or wheeled vehicles. Animals-powered transporters would exempt human from manpowered delivery, that will definitely save their strength for better use." typeId="8"/>

It was a large mechanical arm that propelled heavy stones and other missiles from a great distance, battering down walls and inflicting damage on buildings and defenders. Catapults could easily launch projectiles 500 to 1000 feet with a surprising amount of force behind them. Though cumbersome and nearly useless on the battlefield, the catapult was an effective weapon for siege operations." typeId="13"/>

Until the sixth century AD, Byzantium had relied on Teutonic and Hunnish mercenary cavalry, but under Emperor Nicephorus II - known as &quot;The Pale Death&quot; - native heavy cavalry, the Cataphracts, became the cornerstone of Byzantine warfare. The heaviest cavalry of its age, the Cataphract shielded both rider and mount with thick protective armor, making them a terror on the battlefield. The effectiveness of the Byzantine heavy cavalry made the Cataphracts one of the key models for later European knights." typeId="10"/>

Because of their speed, cavalry units were often used for reconnaissance missions and hit-and-run raids on enemy installations and troops. Although warriors fighting from horseback with a variety of weapons date back to ancient Egypt, horse-mounted cavalry as we generally think of it today actually began in the late 1700s. Under Napoleon, the cavalry became an elite force, frequently deployed simultaneously with foot soldiers to mask the movements of the main battle force." typeId="9"/>

Although a militia made up of warriors was inexpensive, they were not match for organized armies. Warriors were usually used as stopgap measures while waiting for superior units to be trained, or to defend a city that had been temporarily cut off from military support. In a crisis situation, an assembly of warriors is better than no defense at all." typeId="3"/>

Whether engaged in farming, commerce, or industry, their actions form the economic infrastructure without which no nation can succeed. Over time, the endless activity of workers has reshaped the very suface of the land by mining hills, cutting down huge stretches of forest, and irrigating hostile terrain into fertile farmland." typeId="2"/>

One of the best ways to do this was to lengthen the reach of the infantrymen by arming them with long, sturdy spears known as pikes. Massed infantry armed with pikes -- particularly in conjunction with archers -- managed to even the battlefield odds. " typeId="5"/>

Swords in antiquity and classical times tended to be relatively short, at first because they were made of bronze and later because they were rarely called upon to penetrate armor. The blade of the classic Roman stabbing sword, the gladius, was only some two feet long, though in the twilight years of the empire the gladius gave way to the spatha, the long slashing sword of the barbarians and forerunner of the great broadswords of medieval Europe." typeId="6"/>
