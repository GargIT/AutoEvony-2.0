A horse must be extensively trained if it is to be successfully used in battle. In their natural state, most horses quite sensibly seek to run away from dangerous situations - say, when surrounded by screaming men armed with sharp objects. A cavalrymen's horse, on the other hand, needs to be able to suppress this instinct and instead instantly carry out any order given it by its rider - no matter how suicidal. Such training takes time and skill - for both mount and rider. Stables provide such training: any civilization which plans to employ large numbers of horsemen would be well-advised to make the investment and build as many stables as possible. " typeId="20">
